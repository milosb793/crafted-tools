# Crafted Tools

A list of useful code snippets, scripts, functions and modules that I looted and crafted through years of everyday work. A list of my everyday helpers that seed up my development. Many of the functions are found on StackOverflow. A huge thanks to all contributors! Supported languages: PHP, Javascript, Python, Bash and more! Feel free to contrubute and craft!
